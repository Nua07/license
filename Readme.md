# OONI License

This repository is a collection of license templates for all OONI software and non-software products.

You should in general use, where possible, these two licenses:

* For software projects use [LICENSE-BSD-3-Clause.txt](LICENSE-BSD-3-Clause.txt)

* For content and open data use [LICENSE-CC4.0-BY-SA.txt](LICENSE-CC4.0-BY-SA.txt)

If for some reason you cannot use one of the above two licenses, we will
evaluate other licenses on a case-by-case basis.

When in doubt reach out to [team@oo](https://ooni.torproject.org/about/#contact).
