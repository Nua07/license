# OONI Legal

This repository is a collection of legal resources (currently licenses) to be
used in software and content repositories.

You should in general use, where possible, these two licenses:

* For software projects use [LICENSE-BSD-3-Clause.txt](LICENSE-BSD-3-Clause.txt)

* For content and open data use [LICENSE-CC4.0-BY-SA.txt](LICENSE-CC4.0-BY-SA.txt)

If for some reason you cannot use one of the above two licenses, we will
evaluate other licenses on a case-by-case basis.

When in doubt reach out to team@oo.
