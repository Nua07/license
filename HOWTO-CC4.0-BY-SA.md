# For repositories

This is the case if you have some git repository that should have a LICENSE
file in the top level directory.

In these cases you should use either:

(recommended) `LICENSE-CC4.0-BY-SA.txt` that includes just the basic text with links to the
full copy of the license. Be sure to replace `<WORK>` with the name of the work
(usually the name of the git repository)

or

`LEGALCODE-CC4.0-BY-SA.txt` that includes the full text of the license

# For web content

All you need to do is copy and paste this snippet on the website:

```

```

This should be shown inside of the footer of every page that the license
applies to.
