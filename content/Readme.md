# OONI Content

This means all the website content, the research reports and all media assets
(such as the logos and illustrations).

## For repositories

This is the case if you have some git repository that should have a LICENSE
file in the top level directory.

In these cases you should use either:

(recommended) `LICENSE.md` that includes just the basic text with links to the
full copy of the license.

and

(optional) `CC4.0-BY-SA.txt` that includes the full text of the license

## For web content

All you need to do is copy and paste this snippet on the website:
